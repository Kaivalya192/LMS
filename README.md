# Line Following Maze Solver Robot using Arduino IDE

## Overview
This GitHub repository contains the source code and resources for a Line Following Maze Solver Robot, implementing the Line Following Robot (LFR) method with a 5-IR sensor array. Additionally, a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller is integrated into the code for precise control of a differential drive robot. This combination allows the robot to efficiently navigate through mazes by following a predefined line.

Features
* LFR Algorithm: Utilizes a 5-IR sensor array to detect and follow a black line on a contrasting surface, allowing the robot to navigate through maze paths.
* PID Controller: Implements a PID controller for a differential drive robot, providing accurate and smooth control in response to sensor input.
* Maze Solving Logic: Utilizes decision-making algorithms to navigate through maze intersections, optimizing the path to reach the destination.
